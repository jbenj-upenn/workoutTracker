## Description
This is an app that allows users to keep track of their exercise routines by adding new exercises, adding new exercises to past sessions, or deleting old exercises. The rationale is that users will have greater personal success meeting their goals if they are able to keep current records on an easy-to-use application. 

## Installation
Mongoose, Express

## Contributors
